# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing TanStack Router error handling system to provide comprehensive error information including exact file locations, line numbers, stack traces, and user-friendly error messages. The enhanced error handling will help developers quickly identify and debug issues while providing a better user experience during development and production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see detailed error information including file names, line numbers, and stack traces when errors occur in my TanStack Router application, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any route component THEN the system SHALL display the exact file path where the error originated
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the specific line number where the error occurred
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a complete stack trace with clickable file links
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display the error message and error type
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve the original error object for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want different error display modes for development and production environments, so that sensitive error information is not exposed to end users while still being available for debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running in development mode THEN the system SHALL display full error details including stack traces and file paths
2. WHEN the application is running in production mode THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages without exposing internal file paths
3. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle to switch between detailed and user-friendly error views
4. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console for developer access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the error component to handle different types of errors (JavaScript errors, async errors, network errors), so that all error scenarios are properly caught and displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a synchronous JavaScript error occurs THEN the system SHALL catch and display it with full details
2. WHEN an asynchronous error occurs (Promise rejection) THEN the system SHALL catch and display it appropriately
3. WHEN a network request fails THEN the system SHALL display network-specific error information
4. WHEN a route loading error occurs THEN the system SHALL display route-specific error context
5. WHEN multiple errors occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL display all errors in an organized manner

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error recovery options and retry mechanisms, so that users can potentially recover from errors without refreshing the entire page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a "Retry" button to attempt the failed operation again
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a "Go Back" option to return to the previous working state
3. WHEN a route error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide an option to navigate to a safe fallback route
4. WHEN the retry button is clicked THEN the system SHALL attempt to re-execute the failed operation
5. WHEN retry attempts fail multiple times THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative recovery options

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the error component to be visually appealing and well-integrated with the application's design system, so that error states don't break the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error is displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling with the application's design system
2. WHEN displaying error information THEN the system SHALL use proper typography hierarchy and spacing
3. WHEN showing stack traces THEN the system SHALL use monospace fonts and syntax highlighting
4. WHEN displaying multiple error sections THEN the system SHALL use collapsible sections for better organization
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure error information is readable and properly formatted
